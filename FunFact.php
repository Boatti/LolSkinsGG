<h3>1. You Can Make a Poro Grown a Black Moustache</h3>
<p>Everyone loves the adorable Poros, and they’re even cuter with a giant black moustache. Simply feed it Poro-Snax while playing as Braum and the cute little critter will sprout some facial hair to match its burly benefactor.</p>

<h3>2. Shaco is an anagram of Chaos</h3>
<p>This one kinda stares you right in the face until you notice it. The demon jester has inspired enough creepy cosplay to deliver thousands of nightmares, but he’s lighthearted enough to engage in wordplay too.</p>

<h3>3. Jinx Is Dancing Like Jake from Adventure Time</h3>
<p>These two definitely dance to the same drummer.</p>

<h3>4. Zac’s Squishes Were Designed With Some Weird Sound </h3>
<p>The sound effects for Zac’s squishes were “made from dog food and beans inside a condom slapped against a wall.”. Ingenious</p>

<h3>5. The BF Sword Is an Allusion to Doom’s BFG9000</h3>
<p>The BF Sword in League of Legends is a fairly expensive basic item that does about 50 attack damage. Maybe it fetches a premium price because it’s got that “90s cool” attitude straight from Doom’s most over-the-top weapon.</p>

<h3>6. Aatrox Was Inspired by Lord of the Rings Characters</h3>
<p>Mike Laygo, a senior animator on League of Legends, stated that Aatrox’s animations were inspired by Balrog and Sauron. Lago himself has previously worked on Lord of the Rings games.</p>

<h3>7. Use the Jaximus Skin to Catch a Touching Tribute</h3>
<p>In honor of a Make-A-Wish patient who visited Riot Games, Jax will occasionally say, “Here’s to you, kid,” to honor his memory. Jax was his favorite character, and Riot used the Jaximus skin to raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.</p>

<h3>8. Korean LoL Players Make Way More Money Than Americans</h3>
<p>While American players can certainly hold their own in League of Legends, currently Korean players have won a collective total of over 5.5 million dollars from competitions. That’s more than 3 times as much money as Americans have won.</p>

<h3>9. Vi Used to Be a Roller Skater</h3>
<p>Who would have thought that Vi was initially a derby doll? A senior animator for Riot Games said that in her original design Vi was actually named Ruby and enforced the law with the help of some roller skates.</p>

<h3>10. Use the Jaximus Skin to Catch a Touching Tribute23. Kassadin Might Be the Most Frequently Nerfed Champion</h3>
<p>In honor of a Make-A-Wish patient who visited Riot Games, Jax will occasionally say, “Here’s to you, kid,” to honor his memory. Jax was his favorite character, and Riot used the Jaximus skin to raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.</p>

<h3>11. Kassadin Might Be the Most Frequently Nerfed Champion</h3>
<p>While Irelia gets all the notoriety for nerfing, Kassadin’s actually had his skill set swatted down more often. He recently had his cooldown time increased by 8 seconds. The poor guy can’t catch a break.</p>
